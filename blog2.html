        <h1>Basic About Renewable Energy: Why People Still Not Interested Even Though It's Free and Clean </h1>
    <p>
        Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are recovered naturally and may be utilized without losing finite resources. 
        There are several types of renewable energy sources:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sunlight</li>
        <li>Wind</li>
        <li>Rain</li>
        <li>Tides</li>
        <li>Waves</li>
        <li>Geothermal heat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Renewable energy technologies create electricity using sustainable ways, unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to environmental pollution.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Sunlight is converted into electricity using photovoltaic cells or concentrating solar power plants.</p>
    <p><strong>Wind Power:</strong> Converts the kinetic energy of flowing air into electricity by turning turbines.</p>
    <p><strong>Tidal and Wave Energy:</strong> Utilize the force of ocean currents.</p>
    <p><strong>Hydropower:</strong> Harnesses the energy of flowing water.</p>
    <p><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Uses steam or hot water from subsurface reservoirs to tap into the Earth's interior heat.</p>

    <p>
        Renewable energy development is vital for lowering greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating climate change, and assuring a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.
    </p>

    <h3>Renewable Energy Sources 101: Overview and Comparison - The Earth Project</h3>

    <p>
        Today we will be talking about <strong>solar power</strong> only, also known as PV or Photovoltaic. 
        PV, which stands for Photovoltaic, but what does it mean, how does it work, and how can we use it in our daily lives to reduce dependency on fossil fuel-based electricity?
    </p>

    <h4>How is Electricity Typically Generated in a Power Plant?</h4>

    <p>
        Electricity is typically created from fossil fuels (i.e., coal, gas, and oil) through a process that requires burning these fuels to produce heat, which is then utilized to generate steam. 
        The steam powers turbines that are connected to generators, which generate energy.
    </p>

    <p>Here's a more in-depth explanation of the procedure step-by-step:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combustion of Fossil Fuels:</strong> In power plants, fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are burnt in a chamber. This combustion produces heat as a byproduct.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Generation:</strong> The heat produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is utilized to heat water, generating steam. Typically, this is done in a boiler.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam Expansion:</strong> The high-pressure steam produced by the heated water is fed into a turbine. The turbine blades rotate due to the force of the steam.</li>
        <li><strong>Turbine Rotation:</strong> As the turbine blades spin, they are connected to a generator. The rotation of the turbine's blades turns the generator's rotor, which is surrounded by a magnetic field.</li>
        <li><strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> Applying the concepts of electromagnetic induction, the rotation of the turbine's rotor inside the magnetic field generates an electric current in the generator's coils. This current is referred to as electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> The produced electricity is then transmitted across large distances using power lines, transformers, and other equipment to enhance the voltage.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Finally, local power lines and substations provide electricity to homes, businesses, and industries. Everything from lights and appliances to industries and technological devices is powered by this.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        It is extremely important to remember that, while this technique has been the base of global power generation for many years, it is also hazardous for the environment. 
        Carbon dioxide and other pollutants are released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned, leading to air pollution and climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a result, there is a rising demand for moving to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power.
    </p>

    <h4>How Does a Solar Power System Work?</h4>

    <p>
        A solar power system, also known as a solar photovoltaic (PV) system, converts sunlight directly into electricity using solar panels. Here's how a typical solar power system works:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Panels (Photovoltaic Cells):</strong> Solar panels consist of a number of photovoltaic cells, which are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into energy. These cells are often constructed of materials such as silicon.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight Absorption:</strong> When sunlight (photons) hits the surface of the solar panels, it excites electrons within the semiconductor material, generating a flow of direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverter Conversion:</strong> The DC electricity generated by the solar panels passes through an inverter. The major function of the inverter is to convert direct current (DC) power into alternating current (AC) electricity, which is the kind of electricity utilized in most homes and businesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Panel and Utility Connection:</strong> The inverter's alternating current power is then delivered to the building's electrical panel. This panel distributes energy to the structure's multiple electronic devices, enabling it to power lights, appliances, and other equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Consumption and Grid Interaction:</strong> If the solar panels generate more power than the building requires, the extra energy can be sent back into the grid. This happens through a procedure known as net metering. In this case, the electric meter reverses its rotation, thereby crediting the extra energy provided to the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Nighttime and Low Sunlight Conditions:</strong> When the solar panels are not producing electricity at night or during periods of low sunshine, the building gets power from the grid as usual.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Solar energy facilities vary in size and design, from relatively small rooftop installations in private residences to large-scale solar farms that contribute to the grid's overall electricity supply.
    </p>

    <p>Depending on the scale of the solar system, we can categorize it into three (3) main domains:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Residential</li>
        <li>Commercial and Industrial</li>
        <li>Utility grade or IPP (Independent Power Producer)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A solar power system's efficiency is determined by factors such as the quality and orientation of the solar panels, the quantity of sunlight available, and the overall system design. 
        Solar energy is a clean, renewable form of energy that can help reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.
    </p>

    <p>
        But currently, we are in a state where we canâ€™t fully rely on this cleaner and greener energy source. At present, the efficiency of solar cells is between 21-23%, which is less compared to fossil fuels. 
        But developments are ongoing, with scientists working on improving solar system efficiency. However, as a photovoltaic system needs sunlight to generate electricity, even with increased efficiency, it will only be usable during the daytime.
    </p>

    <p>
        But as mentioned earlier, there are other types of renewable energy sources that can produce electricity 24 x 7, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Wind Energy</li>
        <li>Hydropower</li>
        <li>Geothermal Energy</li>
        <li>Biomass Energy</li>
        <li>Tidal Energy</li>
        <li>Wave Energy</li>
        <li>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</li>
        <li>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)</li>
        <li>Bioenergy</li>
    </ul>
